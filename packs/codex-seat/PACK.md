# codex-seat

This pack turns a person's own ChatGPT subscription into a seat their vault can assign work to, through Codex.

## What it does

- **Installs the vendor's tool at first use**, from OpenAI's registry, under its Apache-2.0 license, in the vault's sandbox.
- **Runs the vendor's own device login.** `codex login --device-auth` prints a link and a code; the person opens the link on any device, enters the code, approves. Nothing is pasted back. The credential lands in the seat's own Codex home on the vault volume.
- **Drives the tool through its app-server**, the JSON-RPC surface OpenAI documents for programmatic use. Where OpenAI asks harnesses to identify themselves, the seat says Oneiron.

## What it never does

- Never reads or relays the credential. Never builds a request of its own. Never presents itself as the Codex CLI.

## Permissions the card asks for

Under "Asks for permission": run codex in this vault; reach chatgpt.com and api.openai.com; keep a login store on this vault's volume. The person's tap is the standing grant.

## Requires

The engine's seat row and the headless seat adapter. Until those ship, this folder is a manifest, not an installable pack.
