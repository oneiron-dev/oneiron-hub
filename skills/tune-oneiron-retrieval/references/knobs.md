# The knobs

Every retrieval knob, checked against engine commit `0fdfe222c`. Paths are under `crates/oneiron/src/` unless they say otherwise.

How to read the columns:

- **default** is what the code ships.
- **in code** is the range the engine accepts. Outside it, the engine refuses.
- **try** is a range one proposal may explore, one step at a time. It is a prior from the sources in [sources.md](sources.md). The vault's held-out runs decide.
- **who**:
  - *bandit*: learned per run inside the envelope. Never set its live value.
  - *learner*: learned by the blend tuner. Never set its live value; you may re-seed the tuner's settings.
  - *skill*: a retrieval-skill parameter by design. Today most are compiled, so a change is engine work plus a proposal.
  - *caller*: set per request by whoever calls retrieval.
  - *host*: a vault or host setting. Recommend it; never set it.
  - *wall*: never changes through tuning.

## Effort and the envelope

The caller picks the level. The bandit, once built, picks inside it. You propose the edges.

| knob | code | default | in code | try | who |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| graph depth per level | `memory/recall/mod.rs:93-101` | light 0, medium 1, high 2, xhigh 4, max 10 | PPR depth at most 10 (`ppr/cache_store.rs:37-52`) | move one level by one hop; keep the levels in order | skill |
| rerank top n | `memory/recall/mod.rs:103-108` | 30; 50 at xhigh and max | above 0 | 20 to 100, never below the result limit | skill |
| lease and reranker required | `memory/recall/mod.rs:89-91` | high, xhigh, max | the door refuses without them | — | wall |
| recall PPR seeds | `memory/recall/mod.rs:40` | 8 | at most 256 seeds | 4 to 16 | skill |
| depth-search lane | `retrieval_depth.rs:55-69` | 4 subqueries; 8 seeds; at most 2 rounds of 4 queries | — | — | skill |

At light, retrieval makes no model call and takes no lease. High and up add `expand_ppr` and the rerank. Max also searches both time axes (`pipeline/builder_effort.rs:23-55`).

## Lexical (BM25F)

| knob | code | default | in code | try | who |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| k1 | `bm25/config.rs:151` | 1.2 | pinned; no override | — | engine (ONE-BM25-ADPT is parked) |
| Surface weight, b | `bm25/config.rs:128-132` | 1.00, 0.75 | weight finite and ≥ 0; b in [0, 1] (`config.rs:479-530`) | keep weight 1.00 as the anchor; b 0.3 to 0.9 | skill; today caller |
| Stem weight, b | `bm25/config.rs:133-137` | 0.35, 0.65 | same | weight 0.1 to 0.6; b 0.3 to 0.9 | skill; today caller |
| NormalizedOverlay weight, b | `bm25/config.rs:138-142` | 0.55, 0 (no length norm) | same | weight 0.3 to 0.8; b stays 0 | skill; today caller |
| CjkNgram weight, b | `bm25/config.rs:143-147` | 0.45, 0.30 | same | weight 0.3 to 0.8; b 0.1 to 0.5 | skill; today caller |
| formula | `bm25/config.rs:56` | Okapi; BM25+ with delta 1.0 on request | delta finite and > 0 | Okapi | skill; today caller |
| per-language dictionaries | `config.rs:338` | none, so portable n-grams | — | install Sudachi for Japanese | host |
| detection window | `crates/oneiron-retrieval/src/analyzer/detect.rs:19` | 512 bytes | — | — | engine |
| phonetic score | `ports/lmdb_phonetic.rs:51-53` | +1 per matched code; ×1.2 at 2 or more | codes come from the caller | — | caller |

The weights and b are scoring-only: a `Bm25RankProfile` per query changes them with no reindex (`config.rs:427`). A dictionary changes the index itself. Flipping a language between portable and morphological mode on a non-empty index fails closed until `clear_text_index` rebuilds it (ARCH-0031).

## Vectors (HNSW)

| knob | code | default | in code | try | who |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ef_search | `config.rs:250` | 128 | the beam is max(ef_search, limit) (`hnsw/search.rs:108`) | 64 to 512 | host; skill by design |
| m_max_0, ef_construction | `config.rs:248-249` | 64, 200 | persisted; a different value fails the open (`store/open_gates/hnsw_model_gates.rs:114-131`) | leave them | host |
| fast_dims | `config.rs:303` | unset | 1 ≤ fast_dims < dimensions; a change on a populated vault fails the open | leave it until a bake-off picks one | host |
| dimensions | `config.rs:283` | 1024 device, 4096 server | pinned with the model | — | host |
| query embedding | `retrieval_depth/controls.rs:47-53` | none unless the host passes one | — | pass one whenever the vault has an embedder | host |

Distance is cosine (`crates/oneiron-retrieval/src/distance.rs:18-26`). The defaults already sit at the high-recall end. Under about 100K vectors, exact search is nearly as fast and gives the recall oracle. Check recall@10 against brute force with `oneiron-bench vector` before and after any change.

## Fusion and blend

| knob | code | default | in code | try | who |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| channel fusion | `crates/oneiron-retrieval/src/fusion.rs:70-113` | each channel's list is z-scored; a candidate missing from a list gets that list's lowest z; the sum is relevance | a list with one hit or no variance contributes zeros (`fusion.rs:309-328`) | — | skill (formula, Tier 2) |
| relevance log weight | `crates/oneiron-retrieval/src/fusion.rs:38` | 1.0 | fixed | — | skill |
| blend weights | `crates/oneiron-contracts/src/retrieval_telemetry.rs:60-76` | recency 0.35, salience 0.30, confidence 0.20, gravity 0.15 | each finite and ≥ 0; positive sum; used as stored | — | learner |
| tuner settings | `store/retrieval_telemetry/types.rs:127-141` | 1024 runs, learning rate 0.05, 1 reward minimum | positive values | learning rate 0.01 to 0.1; reward minimum 30 or more | host today; skill by design |
| recency half-life by entity type | `pipeline/types.rs:69-99` | claim, turn, session and message 28 days; person 365; relationship, place, org 180; event 30; skill and summary 90; notification 7 | unknown types fall back to 28 | ×0.5 to ×2 for one type per proposal | skill; compiled |
| claim access decay by class | `claim/decay.rs:26-35` | durable 365 days, standard 90, ephemeral 14; floor 0.05; superseded, retracted or expired claims 0 | caller overrides in [0, 1] for live claims only | — | skill; compiled |
| contiguity boost | `pipeline/blend.rs:344` | 1 + 0.2 × contiguity, when the caller turns it on | — | — | skill |
| ghost-vector threshold | `pipeline/types.rs:121` | 0.3 cosine | — | re-derive per embedder | skill |

The blend works in log space: relevance plus each weight times its z-scored signal, then exp (`crates/oneiron-retrieval/src/fusion.rs:145-172`). The read-side access factor multiplies after that. The trace's `fused` stage shows a reciprocal-rank order with k = 60 for display only (`pipeline/types.rs:56`).

## Graph (PPR)

| knob | code | default | in code | try | who |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| damping (teleport) | `pipeline/types.rs:117` | 0.15 | also a literal 0.15 at `ppr_community/bridge.rs:33` | 0.10 to 0.30 | skill; compiled |
| λ budget per edge kind | `ppr/policy.rs:84-118` | belongs_to, claim_of, supports, participates_in 1.0; authored_by 0.9; part_of, attached 0.8; scoped_to 0.7; mentions 0.6; about 0.5; supersedes, merged_into, split_into 0.3; derived_from 0.2; employed_by 0.1; facet and world kinds 0.05 | — | ×0.5 to ×1.5 for one kind per proposal | skill; compiled, and pinned to the docs contract table |
| opposes λ; untraversed kinds | `ppr/policy.rs:84-130` | opposes 0; child_of, assigned_to, blocked_by, same_as and others not traversed | — | — | wall |
| part_of hop cap | `ppr/walk.rs:531-540` | 2 | — | — | skill |
| seed weights | `ppr/policy.rs:36-46` | search_ppr: 1/ln(1 + max(mentions, 1)); expand_ppr: uniform | — | — | skill |
| VAD alpha | `config.rs:273-275` | 0 | 0 to 0.4; nonzero needs the BEAM gate | — | host |
| community prior | `ppr_community/types.rs:13-23` | beta 0 (experiment 0.2); gamma 1.0; multiplier cap 1.5 | bounds cannot be relaxed | — | host |
| cache TTL | `ppr/cache_store.rs:29-36` | 24 h if a seed was active under 7 days ago; 72 h under 30 days; 168 h after | — | — | engine |

The cache key holds the damping, VAD alpha and formula version. A change to any of them makes every cached walk miss once. Warm the cache before you measure latency.

## Temporal

| knob | code | default | try | who |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| sigma | `pipeline/types.rs:36` | 1 day | 0.5 to 7 days, for time-bearing queries | skill; caller may pass one |
| minimum window radius | `pipeline/types.rs:37` | 7 days | — | skill |
| score floor | `pipeline/types.rs:38` | 0.05 | — | skill |
| widening rounds | `pipeline/types.rs:118` | 3, doubling sigma each round | 2 to 5 | skill |
| alpha base, range, tau | `pipeline/types.rs:114-116` | 0.7, 0.3, 90 days | — | skill |
| scan cap | `pipeline/types.rs:119-120` | 4 × limit per axis; 8192 seek buffer | — | engine |

A window the host passes turns off the separate recency blend. The effort's own anchor at now keeps it (`pipeline/builder/mod.rs:379-388`).

## Budgets

| knob | code | default | who |
|---|---|---|---|
| result limit | `pipeline/types.rs:35` | 20 | caller |
| recall token budget | `memory/recall/mod.rs:45` | 4000 | skill; ARCH-0004 wants a share of the caller's window instead |
| context-pack token window | `context_pack/types.rs:22` | 4000 | caller |
| token split | `context_pack/types.rs:216-225` | claims 0.45, turns 0.10, summaries 0.25, other 0.20 | skill |
| capabilities per kind | `pipeline/capabilities.rs:15-18` | 5 | skill |
| deadline | `retrieval_depth/controls.rs:8-37` | none; a stage that started finishes | caller |

## Abstention (RET-01, context packs only)

| rule | code | default | who |
|---|---|---|---|
| anomalous query text | `pipeline/budget.rs:230-255` | a control character, or one character repeated 32 times | wall |
| dual-weak | `pipeline/budget.rs:216-224` | a text and a vector query were both sent, no keyword hit survived, and every vector score is under 0.3 | floor |
| poor gap | `pipeline/budget.rs:260-277` | two or more vector scores, top under 0.5, and (top1 − top2) / top1 under 0.1 | floor |

An abstaining pack returns `BelowThreshold` (`pipeline/execution/channels/mod.rs:755-771`). Other empty reasons are `FilterMatchedNone`, `NoData` and `AllActivated` (`context_pack/empty_pack.rs:16-20`). A HyDE retry skips this check for the retry. All three cosine numbers belong to one embedder. Re-derive them from labelled answerable and unanswerable queries at a target false-abstention rate under 5%.

## HyDE and rerank

| knob | code | default | who |
|---|---|---|---|
| HyDE subqueries | `query_expansion.rs:7` | 3 | host |
| HyDE retry limit | `query_expansion.rs:8-9, 55-60` | max(limit, min(2 × limit, 200)), once | host and caller |
| reranker | `rerank.rs:35` | none; the host injects one | host |

## Interactions

1. Every cosine threshold (abstention, ghost vector) belongs to one embedder. A model swap invalidates them all.
2. Depth adds latency and hops, and the reward subtracts both. A deeper walk has to buy more gated hits than it costs.
3. Fusion fills a candidate's missing channels with that channel's lowest z. A channel with many weak hits shifts everyone's relevance; a channel with one hit adds nothing.
4. The blend reorders only the fused pool. Channel limits bound the pool. The result limit cuts after the post-blend scope filters.
5. Two age systems apply: the blend's recency half-life by entity type, and the read-side access decay by claim class. Shorten one without checking the other and age counts twice.
6. `expand_ppr` takes extra seeds from the first relevance-only ranking. A fusion change also moves graph expansion.
7. A HyDE retry doubles channel limits and skips abstention for that retry. Count retries before reading latency.
8. Changing damping or VAD alpha empties the PPR cache's usefulness once. Measure latency warm.
